#Hybrid data structurs
##It combines the strengths of binary search trees(BSTs) and hash tables to optimize operations like search, insertion, and deletion. Traditional BSTs offer ordered storage and efficient traversal but may degrade to linear time complexity in the worst case. Hash tables provide constant-time average-case operations but lack ordered data access.
